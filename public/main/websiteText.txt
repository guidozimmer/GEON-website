                    As a project developer, GEON Group is focused on two strategies for the storage of large amounts of energy with quick charging and discharging cycles:
                    
                    Large, megawatt-class battery arrays
                    Production, transport, and consumption of green hydrogen.
                    GEON Group deploys these storage technologies in its own projects. Our experts can help you develop and implement the right storage strategy for your specific applications, too."
